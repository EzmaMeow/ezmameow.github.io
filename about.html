						I enjoy making things and solving problems. I tend to code with Python, C++, and things like GDscript. Despite my love hate relationship with JavaScript, I still use it for websites though I may have to re-read about somethings if I have not touched it in a while.
					</p>
					<p>
						I do play games a little too much. I tend to play games that feature building or customization more than others. I do enjoy rpgs, strategy, and simulation games. Also games I would like to create usually have some of these themes.
					</p>
					<p>
						I do not really work on websites much, but I prefer to keep a simple style in html and css and then apply js to add extra features if necessary. Web games are an exception since I may embed them so their theme may be simple or broken down into components.
					</p>
					<p>
						In programing, I started liking the idea of making simple components or standalone systems that can be implemented into other projects in whatever way deem fit. This may be because I am too lazy to read the code of plug and play modules as well as not wanting to make such since idiot proofing is a nightmare. I just like knowing what things are done as well as try to simplify it so it may be easier to understand one day.

						I created a chat/helper bot for discord a while back. It is a cat theme that responds with quotes or just act cute. It also has mood states that get displayed as its status. I made it for a friend but also use it to understand how I can work with api.
					</p>
					<p>
						I made a mod for minecraft a while back where most of the world was underwater plus other stuff. I did not want to port it (yet) and decided to try to make a data pack with less features in case I wanted to play in a world that is mostly water. Truth is that I did not spend as much time on the datapack. It was mostly for me to understand datapacks more.
					</p>
					<p>
						I made a python script that periodically reblog post from links I type into the console to Bluesky. The links entered is saved to a file along with the last time a post was reblog. I run it locally when I am active on the computer, but I was lazy with the code, so the code is not visible publicly.
					</p>

						I made a simple fishing game for a friend using some of my art and had it playable in a website. It was simple since I was unable to find enough time to focus before the deadline. The fish can be caught, but the catching logic is very barebones. Mostly it displays a waterscape with fish that swims to a point or swim at a fix point base on their AI. It was made with mostly pyscript since I also wanted it to be something they could learn from (they rather work in python if they do anything in code). I do like working with python instead of js for frontend, but I dislike the load time so I might one day take some of the parts I made and convert to js even though there are probably libraries that are better suited for canvas projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						My main project in Godot is a 2d pixel rpg. The goal is to have turn base combat, though I do want to try to have strategy elements. I may change it to real time if I decided to work (and make progress with) on advance AI navigation. The combat system is being designed to fit various cases so it not really an issue.
