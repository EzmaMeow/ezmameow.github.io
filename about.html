					<p>
						I enjoy making things and solving problems. I tend to code with Python, C++, and things like GDscript. Despite my love hate relationship with JavaScript, I still use it for websites though I may have to re-read about somethings if I have not touched it in a while.
					</p>
					<p>
						I do play games a little too much. I tend to play games that feature building or customization more than others. I do enjoy rpgs, strategy, and simulation games. Also games I would like to create usually have some of these themes.
					</p>
					<p>
						I do not really work on websites much, but I prefer to keep a simple style in html and css and then apply js to add extra features if necessary. Web games are an exception since I may embed them so their theme may be simple or broken down into components.
					</p>
					<p>
						In programing, I started liking the idea of making simple components or standalone systems that can be implemented into other projects in whatever way deem fit. This may be because I am too lazy to read the code of plug and play modules as well as not wanting to make such since idiot proofing is a nightmare. I just like knowing what things are done as well as try to simplify it so it may be easier to understand one day.
